# Who Are the UK's Black Queer Men?
## Executive Summary for Mental Health Reparations Proposal

**Prepared for:** NHS England, Integrated Care Boards, Mental Health Trusts, Policy Makers
**Date:** January 2025
**Context:** Supporting document for mental health reparations proposal

## The Question

To advocate for mental health reparations for Black queer men, we must first establish: **How many Black queer men are there in the UK?**

This executive summary presents evidence-based population estimates synthesizing 2021 Census data, ONS statistics, comparative international research, and Home Office asylum application statistics.

## Key Findings

### Population Estimates

**Conservative estimate: 35,000-40,000 Black queer men in UK**
- Uses disclosed census rates only
- Accounts for stigma-driven undercount
- Defensible as minimum floor

**Recommended working estimate: 50,000-65,000 Black queer men in UK**
- Accounts for younger Black population (median age 31 vs 45 for white)
- Gen Z identifies as LGB at 2x overall rate (6.91% vs 3.16%)
- Includes 25-40% undercount adjustment
- Includes LGBTQ+ people seeking asylum in UK, fleeing colonial-era persecution laws

**London concentration: 25,000-32,500 (approximately 50% of UK total)**
- London has 48% of UK Black population
- London has 37% higher LGB rates than UK average
- Combined effect: ~50% of Black queer men live in Greater London

### Why Population Estimates Vary

Three demographic factors significantly increase estimates above conservative baseline:

**1. Age Demographics (High Confidence)**
- UK Black population median age: **31 years**
- UK white population median age: **43 years**
- **14-year age gap** means Black population concentrated in younger generations
- Gen Z (ages 16-24) identifies as LGB at **6.91%**—more than double overall rate (3.16%)
- **Age adjustment alone increases estimates by 30-60%**

**2. US Comparative Data (Medium Confidence)**
- 2012 Gallup: African Americans identified as LGBT at **4.6%** vs white Americans **3.2%**
- **44% higher rate** among Black populations in US
- UK-specific data not available (ONS has not published race × sexual orientation cross-tabulation)
- Provisional application to UK context suggests similar pattern may exist

**3. People Seeking Asylum (Medium Confidence)**
- ~2,000-2,500 LGBTQ+ people seeking asylum annually based on sexual orientation/gender identity
- Top origins: Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nigeria (all former British colonies with UK-imposed anti-sodomy laws)
- ~40-50% from predominantly Black countries
- **~8,000-12,000 LGBTQ+ people who sought asylum** from Black countries now in UK—with mixed legal statuses including asylum pending, refugee status granted, other leave to remain, or undocumented
- **NOT captured in census data**
- **Note:** These are people exercising their right under international law to claim protection from persecution

## Geographic Distribution for Service Planning

### UK Regions (Estimated)

| Region | Est. Black Queer Men | Strategic Note |
|--------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Greater London** | **25,000-32,500** | 50% of UK total - priority region |
| Greater Manchester | 2,500-3,500 | Second largest concentration |
| West Midlands (Birmingham) | 2,000-3,000 | Third largest |
| West Yorkshire (Leeds/Bradford) | 1,500-2,000 | Significant population |
| Scotland (Glasgow + Edinburgh) | 1,500-2,000 | Dispersed across two cities |
| Rest of UK | 13,500-20,500 | Highly dispersed |

### London: Borough-Level Analysis Using Absolute Numbers

**Critical methodological point:** Percentages hide population scale. Using **absolute numbers** changes strategic priorities.

**Top 5 London Boroughs (by absolute Black population):**

| Borough | Total Pop | Black % | Black Residents | Est. Black Queer Men |
|---------|-----------|---------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Croydon** | 390,719 | 22.64% | **88,500** | **2,000-2,800** |
| Newham | 351,028 | 25.13% | 88,200 | 2,000-2,700 |
| Lewisham | 305,842 | 26.77% | 81,900 | 1,800-2,600 |
| Southwark | 318,830 | 25.13% | 80,100 | 1,800-2,500 |
| Lambeth | 317,498 | 23.97% | 76,100 | 1,700-2,400 |

**Key insight:** Croydon has **largest absolute Black population** (88,500) despite Lewisham having higher percentage (26.77% vs 22.64%). **Absolute numbers, not percentages, should drive resource allocation.**

### Service Delivery Scale Analysis

| Geographic Scale | Population | Viability | Notes |
|------------------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| **Single Borough** | 1,500-2,500 | ❌ Too small | Insufficient for specialized standalone services |
| **Mental Health Trust** | 7,500-10,500 | ✅ Viable | Sufficient for specialized team + peer support |
| **Single ICB** | 7,500-10,000 | ✅ Viable | Comparable to trust scale |
| **Greater London** | 25,000-32,500 | ✅✅ Optimal | Enables comprehensive model + training hub |
| **UK-Wide** | 50,000-65,000 | ⚠️ Complex | Requires coordination across divergent systems |

**Recommendation:** **Mental Health Trust or ICB scale** (7,500-10,500) is minimum viable. **Greater London scale** (25,000-32,500) is optimal for comprehensive service model.

### Mental Health Trust Boundaries vs ICB Boundaries

**Critical finding:** Mental health trust catchments may be MORE strategic than ICB boundaries because they follow demographic clusters rather than administrative convenience.

**Example: South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust**
- Serves: Croydon, Lambeth, Lewisham, Southwark
- Crosses TWO ICBs (South East + South West London)
- Captures **four boroughs with largest absolute Black populations**
- **Total: 7,500-10,500 Black queer men**
- **More strategically aligned than single ICB**

## Critical Policy Context: Place vs People

### November 2025: The Men's Health Strategy

The UK Government published its first-ever **Men's Health Strategy for England**—a 10-year vision acknowledging men live nearly 4 years fewer than women, that suicide is the biggest killer of men under 50 (three-quarters of all suicides), and that healthy life expectancy has declined by 1.5 years. The strategy invests £3.6M in suicide prevention for middle-aged men.

**But the equality impact assessment reveals what's missing:** Gay and bisexual men face elevated risks of mental health challenges and self-harm driven by "structural stigma"—yet specific action is deferred to an "upcoming review." Black men face the highest prostate cancer mortality and ethnic inequalities in diabetes and heart disease persist—yet reliance is placed on separate initiatives. **The intersection—Black queer men—remains unaddressed.** Men from minority ethnic groups and men aged 16-44 were underrepresented in the consultation.

The Baring Foundation's **Creatively Minded and Men** (2024) documents that men—particularly men of colour—are underrepresented in creative mental health programmes. Successful models include Lightpost Theatre Company's work with young Black men in Birmingham, using "shoulder to shoulder" approaches where men connect over shared creative interests rather than direct mental health discussion.

**The strategy creates policy hooks. This proposal delivers targeted intervention for those at the sharpest intersections of risk.**

### The Place-Based Problem

UK health services are organized by administrative boundaries (ICBs, trusts, boroughs, parliamentary constituencies) drawn for bureaucratic convenience, not demographic reality.

**For dispersed minorities like Black queer men, rigid place-based approaches create systematic harm:**

- **Power to Change** invested £80M in "community business" (2015-2023), defined community as "local residents" within walking distance → **zero LGBTQ+ venues funded** despite LGBTQ+ people being ~5% of population
- **BlackOut UK research** (2023-2024): Black queer men have minimal connection to local civil society organizations in their boroughs—not because community doesn't exist, but because it **organizes relationally across geography**, not within postcodes
- **Subsidiarity trap**: Devolving to "local" borough level creates populations too small (1,500-2,500) for specialized services

**Community for Black queer men is RELATIONAL, not geographic:**
- Formed through networks across London and UK
- Travel across boroughs to access chosen community, chosen family, culturally competent spaces
- Organized by identity and affinity, not postcode proximity

### Policy Recommendation: Re-Balancing Place and People

Neither "place-based" nor "people-based" approaches offer perfect solutions. **Both should aspire to "do no harm."**

**Current state:** Rigid place-based approaches generate false boundaries that ignore how humans actually organize, leading to significantly worse outcomes for Black queer men.

**Alternative framework:**
- Recognize community as **relational**, formed across geographic space
- Use administrative boundaries as **pragmatic service delivery** considerations, not community definitions
- Allow resources to flow across boundaries to reach dispersed populations
- Measure success by whether communities are actually reached, not whether services exist in specific postcodes
- Apply "**do no harm**" test to all geographic commissioning decisions

**For mental health reparations proposal:** Services should be commissioned at **city-region scale minimum** (Greater London, Greater Manchester, etc.) to achieve critical mass for specialized Black queer mental health support.

## Mental Health Crisis: Evidence of Harm

### Suicide Attempt Rates

**The London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine / Stonewall study (2016)** of 5,799 gay and bisexual men found **Black gay and bisexual men were five times more likely to attempt suicide than white gay and bisexual men.**

**The Trevor Project UK (2024)** found **29% of Black LGBTQ+ young people attempted suicide in the past year.**

| Population | Relative Risk | Notes |
|------------|---------------|-------|
| General male population | 0.1x (baseline) | National average |
| White gay men | 1.0x (comparison group) | LSHTM/Stonewall 2016 |
| **Black gay/bisexual men** | **5.0x** | **LSHTM/Stonewall 2016 (n=5,799)<br>400% higher risk than white gay men** |

**Using conservative estimate of 50,000 Black queer men and applying 5x relative risk:**
- **~2,500 suicide attempts per year** (conservative estimate)
- **£4.5 million annual A&E costs** (at £1,800 per attempt)

**This proposal: £2.1 million per year preventive support**
- Saves £2.4 million annually in emergency response alone
- **Payback period: 18 months**
- Additional uncounted savings: psychiatric hospitalization, long-term disability, workforce participation

**Economic argument:** This is not a cost—it is a **cost-saving investment** that pays for itself while dramatically improving population health.

## Methodological Transparency

### Data Sources

**High confidence:**
- ONS Census 2021: Ethnicity, age demographics, sexual orientation (England & Wales)
- ONS Sexual Orientation Survey 2021: LGB rates by age
- London borough populations and Black ethnicity percentages

**Medium confidence:**
- Age adjustment magnitude (+30%, could be +20-40%)
- Home Office asylum application data (much withheld from public)

**Low confidence:**
- US racial pattern applicability to UK (need UK-specific research)
- Exact undercount magnitude (estimated 25-50%)

### Limitations and Invitation for Correction

**ONS has NOT released cross-tabulated data on race × sexual orientation.** We synthesize separate data sources (age by ethnicity, sexual orientation by age, US comparative research).

**We welcome correction** from researchers with better data or methodologies. These estimates are provisional and offered transparently with assumptions documented.

---

## Definitions

### "Black" (Expansive, Affinity-Based)

Includes:
- Black African, Black Caribbean, Black Other
- Mixed: White and Black (Caribbean, African, Other)
- Anyone racialized as Black in UK context

**Rationale:** Racial categorization is about perception and treatment, not genetics. Those racialized as mixed navigate anti-Black racism. "Black is Black"—solidarity based on shared experience, not DNA percentages.

**Note:** Mixed White/Black populations have median age **19 years** (youngest UK demographic), meaning majority are Gen Z with much higher LGB rates (6.91%).

### "Queer" (Umbrella Term)

Includes:
- Gay men, bisexual men, pansexual men, queer-identified
- Trans men (assigned female at birth, transitioning or transitioned)
- Non-binary people on masculine spectrum
- "Men who have sex with men" (MSM) who may not use identity labels

**Note on trans men:** Many trans men are also gay/bisexual/queer. We estimate ~3,000-4,000 **additional** straight trans men to avoid double-counting.

**Undercount caveat:** Many Black men have same-sex relationships but don't disclose on census due to stigma, "down low" phenomenon, family pressure, or fear. **Our figures likely UNDERCOUNT actual population by 25-50%.**

## Implications for Service Commissioning

### Recommended Approach: Phased Implementation

**Phase 1 (Years 1-3): Single Mental Health Trust**
- **Scale:** 7,500-10,500 Black queer men
- **Geography:** E.g., South London and Maudsley Trust (Croydon, Lambeth, Lewisham, Southwark)
- **Budget:** £2.5M (£60/person/year)
- **Enables:** Specialized clinical team, peer support, cultural competence training
- **Test:** Does trust scale enable sufficient specialization while remaining manageable?

**Phase 2 (Years 4-5): Greater London**
- **Scale:** 25,000-32,500 Black queer men
- **Geography:** All London (5 ICBs, multiple trusts)
- **Budget:** £5M additional
- **Enables:** London-wide coordination, training hub, research partnerships
- **Test:** Can we coordinate across administrative boundaries while serving dispersed communities?

**Phase 3 (Years 6-10): UK-Wide Strategic Urban Centers**
- **Scale:** 50,000-65,000 Black queer men
- **Geography:** London, Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Bristol, Glasgow, Edinburgh
- **Budget:** Scale based on Phase 1-2 learnings
- **Test:** Can we serve dispersed UK communities without rigid place-based restrictions?

**Key innovation:** Resources flow where communities ARE (relationally organized), not locked to administrative boundaries.

## Strategic Recommendations

### For NHS England / ICB Commissioners

1. **Commission at city-region scale minimum** (not borough level) to achieve critical mass for specialized services
2. **Allow cross-boundary resource flow** to reach identity-based dispersed communities
3. **Use absolute numbers, not percentages**, when analyzing borough-level concentration
4. **Consider mental health trust catchments** as potentially more strategic than ICB boundaries for this population
5. **Measure success by community reach**, not service location within specific postcodes

### For Mental Health Trusts

1. **SLaM (or equivalent trusts serving high Black population boroughs)** is optimal Phase 1 location
2. Trust-level commissioning (7,500-10,500 population) is **minimum viable scale**
3. **Partnership with community organizations** essential—Black queer men don't connect to local civil society orgs, but do connect to identity-based London-wide/UK-wide networks

### For Greater London Authority / Mayor of London

1. London has **50% of UK Black queer men** (25,000-32,500)—strongest case for city-wide initiative
2. **Cross-ICB coordination** required (5 London ICBs serve dispersed population)
3. **Link to existing London strategies:** Thrive LDN, Mayor's LGBTQ+ Action Plan, Race Equality Action Plan

### For Policy Makers (All Levels)

1. **Re-examine place-based assumptions** for all dispersed minority populations
2. Apply **"do no harm" test**: Does this geographic boundary systematically exclude those who organize relationally?
3. **Invest in UK-specific research** on race × sexual orientation to improve population estimates
4. **Request ONS publish cross-tabulated data** on ethnicity and sexual orientation from Census 2021

## Conclusion: Why These Numbers Matter

Population estimates inform:
- **Resource allocation**: How much funding required?
- **Geographic scope**: Where should services be positioned?
- **Service design**: What scale enables specialized support?
- **Political advocacy**: Are numbers sufficient to warrant institutional response?

**Conservative estimate (35,000-40,000)** is defensible floor using disclosed census rates.

**Recommended estimate (50,000-65,000)** accounts for demographic factors (younger Black population, generational LGB shifts, LGBTQ+ people seeking asylum, undercount).

**Either way:** Black queer men are **five times more likely to attempt suicide** than white gay men (LSHTM/Stonewall 2016). When health disparities are this severe, targeted interventions are public health necessity and reparative justice.

**For £2.1M per year** (less than half current A&E costs), we can provide preventive mental health support reaching thousands, saving lives while reducing NHS emergency spending.

When we know better, we do better. The data is clear. The question is whether we care enough to act.
